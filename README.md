Knowledge map visualization library


## Demo
The knowledge map library is the core component for Metacademy's interactive knowledge map, e.g. [metacademy graph demo](http://metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/bayesian_linear_regression#focus=bayesian_linear_regression&mode=explore)

## Installation

Coming soon (send me an email if you need this right now)


## Notes
The knowledge map visualization library is a work in progress -- it was extracted from the [metacademy application codebase](https://github.com/metacademy/metacademy-application). I am currently working on making this code easy to use by itself while still maintaining compatability with metacademy. Please contact me (coloradoNospam at berkeley dot edu, remove the no spam part) if you want to use this code for your own project but are having trouble figuring out the code.
